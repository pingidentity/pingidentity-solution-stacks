# NOTICE: the values in this file will override the values provided to the container
#         
#         if that is not the intent, and a default value should be set instead
#         use a syntax like:
#            MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_0=${MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_0:=myDefaultValue}
#                or
#            MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1=${MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1:-wasNotSetElsewhere}
#         
#         Also be aware that many of these variable have default values set in the Docker image.
#         If that is the case the variable is never not set, you may have to override the value
